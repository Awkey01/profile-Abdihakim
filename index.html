            <h1>Know little about me</h1>
            <p>Highly Energetic and passionate about Anything related technology and IT industry at large.</p>
            <p>During my time at high school where I was introduced to what's <br> a computer I had no idea what's happening behind the doors and I decided from that day I will do Information Communication <br>
             as a carrier and quickly after finishing my highschool I was enrolled at a college and started learning about this new industry</p>
             <p>In the first semester I was introduced to so many concepts <br>including programming and networking. Honestly, I liked the programming idea <br>and wondered
                 how computers process information, and I got excited about the concepts and was taught VB as my first programming language</p>
                 <p>I believe it was a nice start but the journey was horrible <br>because of the styles of the lectures and started searching on my own and walked away from the college</p>
               <p>As I was looking somewhere to learn how to program, <br>I came across moringa and without hesitation I enrolled moringa prep and I believe it's the right place to
                    explore a lot of concepts and learn how to grow from these energetic mentors</p>
                    <p>In addition to that I like sports, gaming and hanging with friends is my thing</p>
